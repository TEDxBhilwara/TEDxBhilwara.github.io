    <p>
      26th July 2015, like any other Sunday had a laid back start for many in Bhilwara, however a bunch of 

students could be seen rushing around in the Town Hall- two registration desks neatly draped in a 

white cloth were set on the top lay crisp brochures, giving the detail about the program and brief 

about the speakers, stacked delegate pass that were to be given to the attendees and a couple of 

students setting up their laptops to begin registrations. On the left were standees displaying a 

graphic of all the speakers, what caught my attention was a white board where in the attendees 

where to write an idea worth spreading. The stage was all set with creatives done by Bhilwara’s 

renowned artist Mr K.G. Kadam, a few speakers scattered on the stage engrossed in their last minute 

practice. By 9:30 a few attendees had started entering, they were politely directed towards the 

registration desk wherein their details were fed.  With time empty seats were filled, doors shut and 

the event kick started.</p>

<p>Divided in two halves, the first half started with an absorbing performance by a local band of young 

musicians. They had a way with music and effortlessly mixed Rajasthani folk with other genres 

leaving the hall buzzing with thunderous applause- which never really stopped throughout the day. 

One by one the speakers presented their ideas stating with Nirman Dave (entrepreneur), followed 

by Lucy Naipanoi (Illiterate Solar Engineer) and Bhanwar Mehgwanshi (Journalist and Social activist). 

The first half got over rather quickly, many of them were already brimming with ideas and I could 

see the plain white board filling up with sticky notes.</p> 

<p>I approached a bunch of high school students, it was their first ever Ted event on enquiring about 

the experience one of them sprang and said “I think it was the best decision to attend this on a 

Sunday morning” to which others giggled and agreed. Spotted one of the known mentors and public 

speaker in the crowd, in his words “It is a very good initiative taken by the volunteers, I am glad that 

so many young students are attending such an event and Tedx Bhilwara is definitely inspiring them 

all.” Some students came from smaller towns around Bhilwara “We got to know of the event from a 

friend who studies in Bhilwara, missing it would have been and unfortunate thing.” The 

heterogeneous crowd was a mix of students, parents and teachers alike. A group of parents and 

teachers concluded “In today’s fast paced world one should be informed of innovations around 

them, Tedx Bhilwara offers a great platform to bring out these ideas and inspire all of us to do 

more.”</p>

<p>The second half started after the small break, the remaining speakers presented their ideas – Tarang 

Tripathi (Educationist), Ishita Katyal (Author), Chirag Singal (Traveller), Nilay Kulkarni (Programmer) 

and Vasundhara Choudhary (Youngest Sarpanch). Although the event ended attendees were still 

seated for a while, trying to soak it all in- the ideas, the moments and above all the whole 

experience. A number of them eager to meet the respective speaker who touched their soul and to 

know more about their path swarmed them. Young Ishita Katyal was happily signing the copies of 

her book, Lucy had inspired many homemakers to take the first step, Chirag was seen sharing 

incredible memories from his intrepid travels and so were others exchanging concepts and 

awakening thoughts.  As the attendees started to leave, a number of them thanked the organisers 

and they in turned smiled- a smile that was brimming with happiness- they knew Tedx has touched 

many souls and stirred great number of ideas – The event was a success.</p>

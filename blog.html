    <b><p>
      26th July 2015, like any other Sunday had a laid back start for many in Bhilwara, however a bunch of 

students could be seen rushing around in the Town Hall- two registration desks neatly draped in a 

white cloth were set on the top lay crisp brochures, giving the detail about the program and brief 

about the speakers, stacked delegate pass that were to be given to the attendees and a couple of 

students setting up their laptops to begin registrations. On the left were standees displaying a 

graphic of all the speakers, what caught my attention was a white board where in the attendees 

where to write an idea worth spreading. The stage was all set with creatives done by Bhilwara’s 

renowned artist Mr K.G. Kadam, a few speakers scattered on the stage engrossed in their last minute 

practice. By 9:30 a few attendees had started entering, they were politely directed towards the 

registration desk wherein their details were fed.  With time empty seats were filled, doors shut and 

the event kick started.</p>


<p>Divided in two halves, the first half started with an absorbing performance by a local band of young 

musicians. They had a way with music and effortlessly mixed Rajasthani folk with other genres 

leaving the hall buzzing with thunderous applause- which never really stopped throughout the day. 

One by one the speakers presented their ideas starting with Nirman Dave (entrepreneur), 

Lucy Naipanoi (Illiterate Solar Engineer), Bhanwar Mehgwanshi (Journalist and Social activist) followed by Ishita Katyal (Youngest Author). 

The first half got over rather quickly, many of them were already brimming with ideas and I could 

see the plain white board filling up with sticky notes.</p> 

<p>I approached a bunch of high school students, it was their first ever Ted event on enquiring about 

the experience one of them sprang and said “I think it was the best decision to attend this on a 

Sunday morning” to which others giggled and agreed. Spotted one of the known mentors and public 

speaker in the crowd, in his words “It is a very good initiative taken by the volunteers, I am glad that 

so many young students are attending such an event and Tedx Bhilwara is definitely inspiring them 

all.” Some students came from smaller towns around Bhilwara “We got to know of the event from a 

friend who studies in Bhilwara, missing it would have been and unfortunate thing.” The 

heterogeneous crowd was a mix of students, parents and teachers alike. A group of parents and 

teachers concluded “In today’s fast paced world one should be informed of innovations around 

them, Tedx Bhilwara offers a great platform to bring out these ideas and inspire all of us to do 

more.”</p>

<p>The second half started after the small break, the remaining speakers presented their ideas – Tarang 

Tripathi (Educationist), Chirag Singal (Traveller), Nilay Kulkarni (Programmer) 

and Vasundhara Choudhary (Youngest Sarpanch). Although the event ended attendees were still 

seated for a while, trying to soak it all in- the ideas, the moments and above all the whole 

experience. A number of them eager to meet the respective speaker who touched their soul and to 

know more about their path swarmed them. Young Ishita Katyal was happily signing the copies of 

her book, Lucy had inspired many homemakers to take the first step, Chirag was seen sharing 

incredible memories from his intrepid travels and so were others exchanging concepts and 

awakening thoughts.  As the attendees started to leave, a number of them thanked the organisers 

and they in turned smiled- a smile that was brimming with happiness- they knew Tedx has touched 

many souls and stirred great number of ideas – The event was a success.</p></b>

This was the second time that this event was organized in our 

city and now as I think of it, I’m glad that I associated myself 

with this event. In the beginning I was a little apprehensive 

whether it’s really my cup of tea but as we started working 

towards creating success my concern just faded away. I made a 

big mistake of associating TEDX with some boring convention 

wherein geniuses came and blabbered about their success 

stories to the crowd. The mere thought of it made me decide 

that I won’t be a part of this event but when I surfed online I 

came across some really intriguing TED talks that instantly 

made me change my mind. </p><p>Our curator asked me if I’d like to 

be the compere, to which I clearly agreed. Hosting this event 

opened up a whole new array of management tricks to me and 

made me a more responsible person. It taught me that before 

creating smart cities, one should create smart citizens. It gave 

me a moment of self realization wherein I questioned myself 

that why wait till tomorrow when I can start today? When we 

are born we’re just a plain white canvas with no preconceived 

notions. As we grow up we absorb the colors of education, 

culture, ethics, etc. TED is the brush that crafts beautiful ideas 

on it and turns it into a masterpiece. It doesn’t tell you what is 

wrong and what’s right. It gives you the sense to make a 

decision on your own. I’m already in love with the idea of 

“germinating ideas, cultivating stories”. I wish that these seeds 

turn into a whole new generation of responsible citizens that 

yield a better tomorrow.

    <b><p>
      Bhilwara, a city of opportunities, on the 26th of July, 2015 once again offered a vista to its 

people to enjoy an event which has made a gigantic impact on myriad population of this 

planet. The event, called TEDx, in the fortitude of ideas which are worth spreading, is a 

local, self-organized event to share a TED-like experience with the people in a particular 

town, city or any other region.  And after all a TED-like incident was definitely felt by the 

audience who attended the TEDx held in Bhilwara. The uplifting experience started with a 

concert joining the students having ages poles apart and it exemplified the audience with 

the strength of Indian music. </p>

<p>After an amusing introduction of TED, the stage welcomed the evening's first speaker, 

Nirman Dave. A person who was so inspired by Steve Jobs, Archimedes and many other 

personalities who took a break that he too followed their glorious steps and solely built an 

organization which is developing computer software. This software broke the barriers of 

language as the one making use of it would be able to write software in his own language. 

He also developed a software in which circuits could be made with a pencil.</p>

<p>Following Nirman was the second speaker of the evening who took charge of the stage with 

her inspiring story. Lucy, a grandmother of five and belonging to a community of illiterate 

people, was rejected by the society because she proposed the importance of education. She 

never gave up and decided to become a solar mama by entering into Barefoot College . She 

said that she would light up people's life as well as her village.</p>

<p>A Dalit Rights Activist was then up in the speakers list. Bhanwar Meghwanshi decided to 

take up journalism and activism when he found himself exasperated by the corrupt system. 

He recited his life experiences concerning equality and quoted, "There is nothing as a 

special citizen, everyone is the same as whatever you are, you are the citizen of the 

country."</p>

<p>Ishita Katyal, a nine year old author, is building huge blocks of inspiration for the world and  

especially for the children of her age. She is a perfect example of saying, "Age is just a 

number". She shared her experiences of the social life she had after she wrote a novel called 

Simran's Diary at a tender age of eight. She is setting colossal examples as she is proceeding 

in life since she was an Organizer and Licensee of a TEDx held in Pune.</p>

<p>Isn't it quite hard to consider that someone covered a distance of about thirteen thousand 

kilometers just by 'Riding on Emotions'? Riding on Emotions was the given name of the 

next speaker's bicycle. He has travelled that much distance from India to Vietnam and 

shared his story with the spectators and said with high passion, "Road is the biggest 

University."</p>

<p>Tarang Tripathi, a man who decided that the mentality of the populace in the country about 

schools has to be changed, established and built an organization called Project Aawaaz. The 

motive of the project was to make children alert of the existing situation of the country so 

that when they grow up, they take a stand and call upon a massive change in the country 

which would be the ultimate step to a completely developed country. </p>

<p>The listeners later had a stunned expression when they heard the next speaker tell them 

that each and every person who entered the passage were counted. Nilay Kulkarni is a 

programming prodigy and has come up with various helpful apps and software. On the day 

of the biggest event in the city, Nilay said something which lit brains in the audiences. The 

quote was, "Let's become a smart citizen before developing a smart city."</p>

<p>The final speaker, Vasundhara Choudhary, is amongst the list of one of the youngest 

sarpanch in the country. She utilized her valued time in telling the audience about the 

tribulations she faced when the elder staff refused to co-operate with someone who's half 

their age. She inspired them and concluded, "India is in a very bad condition. Just step up 

and say "I will"."</p>

<p>The audience left the hall with an enormous smile on their faces and a huge desire-to-do-

some-shit-someday on their brains after the event's Organizer, Harsh Agarwal, thanked the 

volunteers with a great speech. The efforts for a successful third edition of TEDxBhilwara  

has been initiated and the city hopes for even more this time.</p></b>
